# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide provided an introduction to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github, as well as other basic concepts for developers. Additionally it laid a foundation of basic skills that will be built upon during the bootcamp as well as a career as a dev. During my time with this project I was introduced to new terminology, the components of a webpage, and became familiar with commonly used dev tools.
